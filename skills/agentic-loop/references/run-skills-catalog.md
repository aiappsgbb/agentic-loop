# Run skills catalog

Reusable **run-phase** agent skills. Unlike the [build skills catalog](build-skills-catalog.md) (skills you install to help *build* the app), these are skills the **agent itself runs** at execution time.

**Reuse, don't regenerate.** When the prompt **explicitly names** one of these skills, reuse it as the local authoring artifact in `./skills/<skill-name>/`, then publish/update its governed version and attach it to the agent's toolbox using current `microsoft-foundry` guidance and supported commands. Verify the agent loads and uses that version. Also reuse explicitly supplied sources outside this catalog. If a named source cannot be resolved, ask rather than silently generating a replacement; author a new skill only when it is actually new or the user approves replacement.

This is a starter set of examples, not an exhaustive list.

For cataloged skills that declare a repository, install with the same command used for build skills:

```bash
gh skill install <repository> <skill> --agent github-copilot --scope project
```

Skills without a repository (`—`) are reused from their named source as agreed with the user; if they are not resolvable from a repository, reuse the local/cataloged version rather than authoring a new one. In all cases, after the skill is present locally, create and version it on Foundry and attach it to the toolbox.
